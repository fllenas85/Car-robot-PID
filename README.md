## Planning
Below is a link to our planning document where we brainstormed ideas, equipments, and time management.

## Wiring
Below is the complete wiring of what we used for this car. 


## Code
Below is our code that oves the car back and forth using PID tuning on a setpoint. (Atticus was here.)

```python
Code goes here
